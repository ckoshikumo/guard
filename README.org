*Guard* is a simple set of macros to deal with errors.

It's heavily inspired by Zed Shaw's debug macros. Like, *heavily*.

It depends on record, another one of my libs. So you have to get that too, and include it before including guard:

#+begin_src C 

#include "../path/to/record.h"
#include "guard.h"

#+end_src

A real readme with examples if forthcoming.
